# Tone-Generator-for-Microntroller-ATMEGA328p

This code is used to generate pure tones at difference frequency, duration and with different inter-stimulus intervals. The user can also choose how many times (sweeps) to present.The microcontroller used is ATMEGA328p. The timer used is the 16 bits timer1. The parameters to change the presentation of the stimuli can be found between lines 9 and 14. 
Two LEDs are also used. The one connected to port PD6 iwill flesh every time the tone is presented, while the one connected to port PB0 will light up after the presentation of the last stimulus.
